{"title": "Struggling to Find English-Speaking Part-Time Jobs in Germany: Seeking Advice and Recommendations", "selftext": "I've found that searching for a part-time job here is a nightmare. Most descriptions are either partially in English with the most crucial information in German, or they\u2019re entirely in German but the job title is in English. They often mention that learners of German are welcome to apply, but if you didn\u2019t translate the job post, you wouldn\u2019t even know you could still apply.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that the only part often written in English is the discrimination clause at the end. It feels counterproductive if half, if not all, of your job description is in German.\n\nI\u2019m aware that Germany has immigration policies that make integration challenging, and I\u2019m also familiar with its past\u2014the Nazism, the human zoos of the 1800s-1900s, and other dark chapters.\n\nBut my question is: if there\u2019s so much concern about people coming to the country and relying on government benefits, why make it so hard for them to find work in the first place? Especially for students who genuinely want to work to support their studies and get ahead in life.\n\nSince I'm struggling to find anything, I would love to hear your thoughts. If you have any recommendations for websites offering real English-speaking jobs or anything where beginner-level German is accepted, please let me know.\n\nAll the best.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m in the process of learning German and I\u2019m conscious that it isn\u2019t gonna happen overnight. In the mean time, I\u2019m still looking for work. So those who think I\u2019m just waiting for it to fall in my lap I\u2019m sorry to disappoint.

After you get out of the U Bahn station, use Google Maps to get to Keplerstra\u00dfe 2. Enter the alley, with a dentist office to your left. Turn left, and it's the door on the ground level. There is a paper hanging on the door for you to write your name.\n\n**Time**\n\nToday they opened at 10:00. However, they gave out exactly 80 waiting numbers at 6:00. I arrived there at 00:45 and I was third in line. After receiving the waiting number, you have the option to go upstairs to the 3rd floor and wait in the waiting room. If not, you can choose to go home and come back at 9:30. \n\n**The Waiting Crowd**\n\nI think because it's October, there were not so many people. At 6:00, there were about 30 people in total waiting in line. The rest of the waiting numbers were all gone by 8:30. 95% of them were students, thanks to the location being primarily for student residence permit.\n\n**My Experience**\n\nI think I went there a bit too early. If it's not August or September, or beginning of Summer Semester, I would recommend to be there only a few hours in advance. I took plenty of water, snacks, and avoided the cold by sitting inside the U Bahn station. \n\nAfter I received my waiting number, I went upstairs. Even though it was at 6:00, there were two ladies working. They called us by our waiting number, and checked all the documents. They mainly check if you have the documents, and nothing so detailed. Except I did witness a girl being rejected immediately because she tried to change her Type C Visa to Type D Visa by just extending it, without providing any sufficient grounds. So I think they do basic filtering, but this probably will not apply to you if you know you are in the right place for the right thing. \n\nI brought the following documents:   \n\\-Matriculation Letter  \n\\-Proof of Health Insurance  \n\\-Anmeldung  \n\\-Part Time Job contract (just in case)  \n\\-My father's income statement (just in case)  \n\\-My father's proof of employment (just in case)  \n\\-Passport  \n\\-Photo I took the day before\n\nI submitted all the documents to the lady, and she gave me a new waiting number. Then I patiently waited, and at around 9:55, they started to call out the numbers. My number got called, and a lady was already waiting for me with my new residence permit. At 10:30, I was finally out with a 4 year extension on my residence permit!\n\nMy German is not good by all means. However, the lady was quite friendly and talked very slowly. I also tried my best to smile and be polite, even though I was really tired. My residence permit also had expired some days ago, but nobody scolded me for that.

{"title": "Master thread: Youth Mobility Visa for Canadians Applying in Germany 2025/2026", "selftext": "When I moved to Hamburg in January 2023 on a 3-month tourist visa (Canadian passport), I applied for the Youth Mobility Program from within Germany \u2014without a job\u2014and quickly discovered how difficult it was to find clear, up-to-date info. Even some immigration officers weren\u2019t familiar with this specific visa, which made the process pretty confusing. So, in true Canadian spirit, over the last two years I\u2019ve compiled everything I learned into one master thread to help future Canadians\u2014and other Working Holiday expats\u2014navigate the process in 2025 and beyond. While this guide will focus primarily on Canadian expats, much of it will apply to others too. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n**VISA**\n\nThis thread is for the Youth Mobility Visa (YMV) which allows young Canadians to live and work in Germany for up to two years. Though, there\u2019s a catch, which I will get into later: it seems that you\u00a0**cannot participate in this YMV two consecutive years in a row**? More on this later on.\u00a0Also, should you apply for this inside Germany, technically you would be applying for a \"residence permit\" and not a \"visa\". Same thing, just specific wording.\n\n**REQUIREMENTS**\n\nFor Canadians, you need to:\n\n* Have a valid passport\n* Be between the ages of 18-35 (if you\u2019re 35 at the time of application, you are eligible even if you turn 36 while in Germany)\u00a0\n* Have at least \u20ac3000 (roughly $4300CAD) in the bank, although I would recommend more, which we\u2019ll get into later.\n\n**COSTS**\n\nThe YMV costs \u20ac113 for the first year when you apply for the visa from within Germany. You will make this payment on the day of your visa appointment at the Auslanderbeh\u00f6rde (Immigration Office), using a credit card. Very simple. Now, every time you renew your visa or get a new residence permit card, you will be required to pay a fee that varies from \u20ac80 to \u20ac113.\n\n**THE 4 DIFFERENT KINDS OF YMV**\u00a0\n\nSomething important to know from the get-go is that there are actually\u00a0**4 different categories**\u00a0of YMVs that can be applied for. Here is a direct copy-paste from the official website of each category:\n\na) Young professionals who wish to obtain further training under a contract of employment and increase their knowledge of Germany\u2019s language, culture and society\u00a0\n\nb) Young citizens who wish to do a work placement in a business in Germany as part of their studies or training\n\nc) Canadian post-secondary students who wish to engage in an occupational activity during their academic vacation\n\nd) Young citizens who wish to stay in Germany for tourism and cultural discovery purposes while being authorized to work to supplement their financial resources.\n\nIf you're moving to Germany for a year, you'll likely apply for the D-category visa. This working holiday visa allows you to work up to 40 hours a week in any job. However, you can\u2019t apply for the D visa two years in a row. To stay for a second year, you\u2019ll need to apply for the A-CATEGORY visa, which requires an official job contract. It can be any job, like in a caf\u00e9, retail, or an agency, as long as it proves you're employed. My advice? Secure a full-time contract in your first year to make applying for the second year easier.\n\nHere's the tricky part: you can't do two Youth Mobility Visas back-to-back. When I tried to extend my stay, immigration wasn\u2019t clear, but since I had a full-time job, they switched me to a standard 19c 4-year work visa. As for the consecutive year issue, it\u2019s still unclear\u2014you might need to leave Germany for 6 months before reapplying. Don't stress, I\u2019ll explain your options later. Just be sure to ask about second-year options during your first visa meeting\u2014it\u2019ll save you a lot of hassle! More details in step 22 of my integration guide.\n\n**FREELANCING**\n\nPlease note: you CANNOT freelance on this type of visa at all. While there are some workarounds that you could figure out, your best bet would be to work for a specific company on a full-time basis. To freelance legally, you can apply for a separate freelance visa which seems to be a bit more complex and complicated. It is doable, however this thread does not cover anything related to this specific type of visa.\n\n**THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO MOVING HERE**\n\n**Language:**\u00a0Germany is a German-speaking country, and when I arrived in Hamburg, I knew no German at all. The excitement of moving abroad fades quickly, and learning the language is key if you plan to stay long-term. Without basic German skills, your job and integration options are limited. I\u2019ve gotten by using the little German I know, but over time, that isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ll start to feel isolated and foreign, because you are.\n\nIf you're only staying a year or two, you\u2019ll manage, but if you're here to build a life, don\u2019t underestimate the importance of learning the language. It\u2019s exhausting when you can\u2019t join in conversations or understand what's happening around you. So, if you\u2019re serious about staying, take learning German seriously from the start.\n\n**Career:**\u00a0Career-wise, the key thing to know is that Germans value full-time contracts and people who want to be part of the system. Once you\u2019re in, things become stable and much smoother. The most important point: if you land a full-time job, pay taxes, and make an effort to learn German (even just the basics), you can stay\u2014**no matter your education level**. Canadians are well-respected here, and staying long-term is very achievable.\n\nTo switch from a Youth Mobility Visa to a 4-year 19C work visa (valid for 4 years) after your first year, you don\u2019t need a degree or special qualifications. I only have a high school diploma and work experience. What you do need is:\n\n* A full-time job contract (any industry\u2014restaurant, retail, marketing, engineering, etc.)\n* A registered address (alone or with roommates)\n* An employer willing to fill out a simple form saying they want to keep you. It\u2019s roughly 4 pages and very easy to fill in the blanks.\u00a0\n\nI wish I had known this from the start\u2014I thought I needed to be a lawyer or doctor to stay in the country.\u00a0**Not true**. If you work, pay taxes, respect the system, and bring good energy, Germany will happily let you stay. If you\u2019re the type who just wants to work a few part-time jobs, or hang around freelancing\u2026 I\u2019m sorry my dear, but this won\u2019t fly easily in a country like Germany.\n\n**Socializing with Germans:**\u00a0Germans aren\u2019t cold\u2014they\u2019re just direct and don\u2019t put on a show. Their social style can seem blunt, but it\u2019s not meant to be rude. Unlike North Americans, who often feel pressure to be overly polite, Germans skip small talk and just be themselves. They\u2019re not trying to \"sell\" you anything, and that honesty can be tough at first. But honestly, that directness helped me grow. You learn to be more authentic and tougher in the process.\n\n**Garbage and recycling:**\u00a0You\u2019ve probably heard the rumors, and yes, Germans take garbage and recycling very seriously. That said, it\u2019s actually pretty easy to get used to once you understand the system. That said, something strange happened to me when I first arrived. I once tried to drop off a large bike box at a recycling bin that was completely full. Since it wouldn\u2019t fit through the slot, I left it neatly beside the bin. A month later, I received a \u20ac150 fine for improper disposal. Totally ridiculous.\n\nSo here\u2019s my advice\u2014always remove your name and address from anything you recycle. If your info is on it and you don\u2019t dispose of it correctly, they can trace it back to you and issue a fine.\n\n**Sundays:**\u00a0In Germany, everything\u2019s closed on Sundays\u2014except caf\u00e9s and restaurants. Malls and grocery stores shut down completely. It\u2019s a throwback at first, but I\u2019ve grown to love the slower pace. Just make sure to do your shopping before 8 PM Saturday, or you're out of luck!\n\n**Cell phone plans:**\u00a0Oh, the joys of European cell phone plans! Unlike Canada, you can get 500GB of data per month for about \u20ac15. I recommend bringing an unlocked phone from Canada and signing up for a month-to-month plan with providers like Smartmobil or Telekom. Avoid long-term contracts, as they can be hard to cancel\u2014many friends have struggled with this. This gives you the flexibility to adjust your plan as needed during your transition.\n\n**Grocery stores and food:**\u00a0One of my favorite things about living in Europe is the strict food regulations, especially on chemicals and pesticides. The food tastes fresher and healthier than back home, and it\u2019s changed how I view nutrition in Canada. Everything feels less processed, and it\u2019s helped me stay in better shape. While grocery stores are diverse, you might miss some products like big tubs of peanut butter. It takes some adjusting, but overall, I\u2019m much happier with my diet here.\n\nExciting update for 2025: Many stores in Germany are now implementing self-checkout, a concept that was new here in recent years. By the time you arrive, you\u2019ll likely avoid long checkout lines.\n\n**Accommodations for the 1st year:**\u00a0I don\u2019t recommend starting your Youth Mobility Visa by living alone. Renting your own place in Germany usually requires a full-time job, steady income, and sometimes German skills. It\u2019s tough unless you\u2019ve got money to spare.\n\nInstead, use\u00a0**WG Gesucht**, Germany\u2019s top site for shared flats. Make a friendly profile with good photos, and pay the \u20ac9 for the premium version\u2014it really helps. Living in a WG (shared flat) for 6\u201312 months gives you time to settle in, meet people, and job hunt without the pressure of a full lease. Sublets are common and worked great for me.\n\nI get it\u2014roommates suck. I had lived alone in Montreal for over four years, so it was a big adjustment. But after a year of sharing a flat with a German woman, I eventually moved into my own studio\u2014and I\u2019m grateful. That transition period gave me the time and space to plan my next step.\n\nNow, speaking of steps\u2026\n\n**Patience in Deutschland:**\u00a0In Germany, patience is a virtue\u2014seriously. Things move slower here, but in a good way. The North American hustle culture doesn\u2019t really exist. Most Germans do their jobs, then fully disconnect to enjoy life. Things take time, and that\u2019s okay. Personally, my work-life balance has never felt healthier.\u00a0\n\n**Paperwork:**\u00a0Please don\u2019t forget\u2014keep track of\u00a0***all***\u00a0**your documents**. Even small papers can be important, especially for immigration. Get a binder and organize everything in one place. It\u2019s saved me from so many headaches.\n\n**SCHUFA Score:**\u00a0This is like a credit score and is sometimes required by landlords. You likely won\u2019t need it right away, since you won\u2019t have a German credit history. But if asked, you can apply easily for around \u20ac20. Just note: you\u2019ll need a registered address to get one, so it\u2019s something to handle when you\u2019re looking for your own apartment.\n\n**Salary:**\u00a0In Germany, you are only paid\u00a0**once per month**, and not biweekly like in Canada. In general, I actually began enjoying this more as it helps to budget your monthly expenses in advance. Truly love it!\n\nReady to apply? This is where the fun begins: an official step by step guide on how to get settled in Germany! Of course, these are the steps that I followed to fully integrate into the country, however some of it may look slightly different to your own. I know, it may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time and trust the process. More importantly, it\u2019s not difficult\u2014just a matter of staying organized and patient throughout. LET\u2019S GO!\u00a0\n\n# FULL WALKTHROUGH\n\n*BEFORE ARRIVING IN GERMANY*\u00a0\n\n**1. Ensure you meet all the requirements for the YMV**\n\nThis is obvious.\u00a0\n\n**2. Choose your city**\u00a0\n\nChoosing a city can be tough, but if you love nature, cycling, and a smaller-city-feel without the chaos of London or Paris, I highly recommend Hamburg. To put it in perspective, Hamburg is like the Montreal of Germany, while Berlin feels more like Toronto on crack. Cologne has a mix of Vancouver and Winnipeg vibes, Munich is comparable to Ottawa, and Kiel reminds me of Halifax. Frankfurt, on the other hand, is somewhere between Edmonton, Ottawa, and Toronto.\n\nIf you're considering Berlin, keep in mind that it's massive and gets very hot in the summer. It\u2019s not my vibe, but it might be the perfect fit for you.\n\n**3. Flatshare or single apartment?**\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, a flatshare is the best way to settle in, giving you time to figure things out while integrating into the country. That said, do whatever feels right for you\n\n**4. Find a place**\u00a0\n\nYou can start looking for housing even before you arrive in Germany using websites like WG Gesucht (better for finding roommates) or Immoscout (more for 1-bedrooms or couples). Create a profile with some nice photos of yourself, and a captivating bio that gives more details about who you are. Now, while Immoscout can be tricky from afar, WG Gesucht makes it easier\u2014you can video call potential flatmates to see if you click. That\u2019s how I did it, and it worked out well. Keep in mind, you\u2019ll need to pay for the premium versions of these sites to get first dibs on the best listings. Most people are paying, so if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll likely miss out.\u00a0\n\n**5. Choose date and book flights**\n\nThis is obvious. Also, if I were you, I would recommend that your passport is valid for at least more than 2 years, as it is a bit easier to renew your passport within Canada compared to doing it from afar. Then again, I renewed it from Germany and it wasn\u2019t hard as well, so just something to think about!\n\n**6. Book Anmeldung appointment prior to arriving in Germany**\n\nAn\u00a0*Anmeldung appointment*\u00a0is your official address registration in Germany. It proves where you live and is essential for things like receiving mail. Everyone moving to or within Germany must register within 14 days of arrival. Appointments fill up fast, so book early\u2014ideally before you arrive. If you already have a place lined up, try to schedule your appointment within two weeks of landing. Just Google \u201cAnmeldung + \\[city\\]\u201d to find the booking page. Each city\u2019s site is a bit different but usually easy to follow.\n\nAlso, remember: when you leave Germany, you\u2019ll need to\u00a0*de-register*. It's just part of the usual German bureaucracy. For reference, I booked mine\u00a0**from Canada**\u00a0before arriving on Jan 1 and had my appointment on Jan 2\u2014super smooth!\n\n**7. Notify CRA, Healthcard, Authorities of departure**\n\nImportant reminder: Be sure to notify all relevant authorities, including the CRA, your provincial tax office, health card providers, dentists, and any other professionals, that you\u2019re leaving Canada. Communicating this early ensures everyone is aware, which will help avoid unexpected bills and complications when filing taxes later. I didn't do this, and it caused issues down the line.\n\n*ONCE ARRIVED IN GERMANY*\u00a0\n\n**8. Move into your new flat**\u00a0\n\nWelcome to Germany! Whether your housing is temporary or long-term, take a moment to celebrate this bold new chapter\u2014you\u2019re about to grow in amazing ways. If you're still on a 3-month tourist visit, make sure to complete steps 9 and 10 quickly to avoid overstaying the 180-day Schengen limit. Look it up if you're unsure about the rules.\n\nA key thing to know: in Germany, your last name\u00a0*must*\u00a0be on your mailbox to receive mail. Without it, you won\u2019t get important letters, including legal or job-related documents. Talk to your landlord or subletter to make sure your name is properly displayed\u2014don\u2019t just tape a note, as that may not work. Also, get yourself a black binder to keep all your documents organized. Staying on top of your paperwork will save you a lot of stress down the line.\n\n**9. Get Anmeldung/Tax Number**\n\nWithin 14 days of arriving, you will need to attend an Anmeldung appointment as mentioned above, which registers you and your address into the system of your city. Go to the appointment. Yay! Now, upon registering your new address into the system at the local immigration office, you will receive an official tax number (Steuernummer) sent by mail. Keep this document stored somewhere, as you will need this later once you become employed. This Steuernummer is basically your SIN number in Canada\u2026 it\u2019s a number that you will use often in Germany, so take note of this and do not lose it!\u00a0\n\n**10. Book your official Youth Mobility visa appointment at local Auslanderbehorde**\u00a0\n\nNow that you\u2019ve received your Anmeldung and tax number, you can immediately book an appointment at the local Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde (immigration office) to apply for your official Youth Mobility Visa. Like the Anmeldung, appointments are made through your city\u2019s official website under \u201cAppointments\u201d \u2192 \u201cVisas.\u201d There may not be a specific option for this visa, so selecting \u201cOther\u201d usually works. Available slots are typically 1\u20132 months out, but don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s 3\u20134 months away. As long as you have a confirmed appointment, you\u2019re allowed to stay in Germany even if it exceeds your 90-day tourist period.\u00a0\n\nFor the appointment, bring your passport, Anmeldung, proof of residence (a piece of addressed mail works), passport-sized photos, and any other documents listed in their confirmation email. Be thorough\u2014missing documents can delay the process. Staying organized is key. I had no issues because I was prepared every step of the way.\n\n**11. Find a bank**\u00a0\n\nWhile my Canadian bank accounts are still active (mostly using my Capital One credit card), I chose to open a German bank account to start living life in euros. The easiest and best option for all expats would be N26 Bank, which has been so easy to use as they have an incredible app. I know, some people have reported that they don\u2019t like it, but I have absolutely loved it. 10/10. I also heard that Revolut was good, but I chose N26 and have no regrets. Most German banks (DKB, Commerzbank, etc) are quite phobic of international folks and require too many steps to open an account. Stick to the ones above.\u00a0\n\n**12. Getting Insurances**\u00a0\n\nOne of the first confusing things in Germany is insurance. Everyone\u2014**regardless of job status**\u2014must have health insurance, and it\u2019s paid monthly. Costs range from \u20ac200\u2013\u20ac700, depending on the provider and coverage.\n\nOnce you have a full-time job, your insurance links to your employer and gets deducted from your paycheck automatically. You won\u2019t even notice it\u2019s gone\u2014it\u2019s just part of the system.\n\nBefore you\u2019re employed, though, you\u2019ll need to pay out of pocket. I used\u00a0**Feather Insurance**\u00a0when I first arrived\u2014it\u2019s affordable, easy to cancel, and costs about \u20ac75/month. It covered everything I needed until I started work. You can check them out at\u00a0Feather Insurance.\n\n**13. Savings/Money**\n\nNow, onto finances \u2014 you might be wondering how much money you need to get through the first few months before finding a job. There\u2019s no exact number, but I came to Germany with around $10,000 in savings, and even then, the first few months were tough. You\u2019ll need to buy essentials like a bed and household items, and those costs add up quickly.\n\nHow much you\u2019ll need depends on your situation:\n\n* Do you already have a job lined up?\n* Can you find one quickly?\n* Do you have a financial safety net?\n* Do you speak German?\n\nI didn\u2019t speak German or have a degree, but I was motivated and focused on job hunting. It took me about three months to find work. During that time, I paid \u20ac600/month for a room in a shared flat and saved where I could. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, but the key was staying focused on getting employed \u2014 that should be your top priority in the beginning.\n\n**14. Start job hunting**\n\nFinding a job in Germany can be challenging, especially if you\u2019re not fluent in German. However, being a native English speaker \u2014 like I am from Canada \u2014 turned out to be a real advantage, particularly in marketing and PR roles. Rather than trying to compete directly with locals, the key is to focus on what makes you different. Your international background, unique perspective, and fresh energy are valuable assets. Use them to your advantage and position yourself as someone who brings something new to the table. In my case, I concentrated my job search within my industry, made use of job fairs, and actively networked on LinkedIn. It took persistence \u2014 I applied to 33 jobs, had 2 interviews, and landed 2 jobs within three months of arriving in Hamburg. When people ask, \u201cDo I need to speak German to get a job?\u201d the answer isn\u2019t black and white. Instead of stressing over that, I focused on the value I could offer, which proved to be a much more effective approach than trying to blend in or compete head-to-head with locals.\n\n**15. Keeping track of German documents**\u00a0\n\nUnlike Canada or Australia, Germany still relies heavily on hard copies. It may seem old-fashioned, but keeping track of all mailed documents\u2014especially from immigration\u2014is crucial. I cannot stress this enough!!! I keep saying it, but that binder will help you to keep everything organized. My smooth integration was largely due to this habit, and I highly recommend doing the same. I brought this binder with me to every appointment, avoiding any type of issues down the line. Thank me later!\n\n**16. Attend your official Youth Mobility Visa appointment**\n\nCongrats\u2014you\u2019re officially allowed to work in Germany! Attending this appointment is a huge step toward integrating into the country. My first appointment? Let\u2019s just say it was... interesting. The immigration officer handling my file had never even heard of the Canadian Youth Mobility Visa. Classic, I told myself. So, he sent me home and told me to come back in two weeks while he read up on it. In the meantime, he handed me a little pink paper called a\u00a0*Fiktionsbescheinigung*\u2014basically a temporary extension while they process your paperwork. You will likely get one of these at some point, although maybe not.\n\nTwo weeks later, I returned, and boom\u2014everything was finalized! He stamped my passport, and here\u2019s the key thing: the visa\u2019s start date wasn\u2019t when I arrived in Germany but the exact day I got that stamp. So, remember\u2014the one-year YMV clock starts ticking from\u00a0*that*\u00a0day!\n\n**17. Secure a job and a full-time contract**\u00a0\n\nBy now, I hope you\u2019ve had the chance to chat with companies and send out a bunch of applications. Now\u2019s the time to lock in a full-time gig! In Germany, the golden ticket is an\u00a0*unbefristet*\u00a0contract\u2014one with no end date. That\u2019s the one you want because it means job security (and no job hunting again anytime soon).\n\nThere\u2019s no magic formula to getting hired, but with persistence\u2014and a little luck\u2014I hope it all falls into place for you!\n\n**18. Choose your insurance provider/Cancel the Feather insurance**\n\nCongratulations on the job! Now it\u2019s time to sort out health insurance. Unlike in Canada, where your employer chooses the provider, in Germany, it\u2019s up to you. You can opt for public or private insurance, but in most cases, public is the way to go. If you go private, you can NEVER switch back to public, so please choose wisely. I recommend TK Insurance\u2014they have an English website and have been very reliable.\n\nOnce you sign up by sending them your employment contract, your insurer will coordinate directly with your employer. The contributions will be deducted automatically from your paycheck, so there\u2019s little for you to do. Just check in with HR, and they\u2019ll guide you through the process. After all of this, you can sign into your Feather account and simply cancel your membership. It was super easy to do for me, and you won\u2019t have any issues.\u00a0\n\n**19. Personalnummer**\n\nThis is not very important, but just so you know: whenever you join a company and secure your insurance plan, you\u2019ll receive a Personalnummer. As an employee, you\u2019ll receive this number from your employer. This unique code is assigned to each employee and is used to securely store your data within the company\u2019s system. It\u2019s important to note that the same number can\u2019t be assigned to two different employees.\n\nJust to clarify, your personnel number is not an official identification number like your ID card number or social security number. It\u2019s simply a reference used within your employer\u2019s administrative system to organize and access your data more easily. It\u2019s not important, but just don\u2019t confuse it with the other ID numbers.\n\n*ONCE SETTLED IN GERMANY WITH A JOB (Optional but important things to do)*\n\n**20. Doctor/health card**\u00a0\n\nOnce you\u2019ve signed up for an insurance plan, you\u2019ll receive your health card in the mail. This card is essential for any medical appointments, so always have it with you. Since moving here over two years ago, I haven\u2019t gotten a family doctor, as I\u2019m not someone who visits the doctor often. I\u2019ve only gone to a clinic for STI tests and visited a walk-in for antibiotics, that\u2019s it. As for finding a family doctor, honestly, I don\u2019t have the answer. My advice? Just Google it!\n\n**21. Dentist**\u00a0\n\nOne thing I found a bit odd when I first moved to Germany is that most insurance plans only cover one dental cleaning per year, and it\u2019s only partially covered. I\u2019m not sure why, but a general cleaning costs around 100 Euros, and after the insurance covers 60, you\u2019ll end up paying about 40 Euros out of pocket. For any major dental work or complex procedures, it\u2019s best to check with your insurance beforehand. On a positive note, my dentist has been great every time I\u2019ve gone.\n\n**22. Home/Accident Insurance**\n\nI know, at this point, you\u2019re probably tired of hearing about insurance, but there\u2019s one more thing I need to mention. Most Germans have personal liability insurance, which covers things like theft, home damage, or even car accidents. For example, if you accidentally crash your bike into someone\u2019s car, this is the insurance that will cover you and ensure you won\u2019t be out XX amounts of euros. I pay just 19 euros a month with\u00a0**Allianz Direct**, and it\u2019s extra coverage that can save you from unfortunate situations involving someone else\u2019s property or your own. I highly recommend it!\n\n**23. Swapping your Canadian Driver\u2019s License for a German one (after 6 months IF you want)**\u00a0\n\nOne of the coolest experiences during my transition was getting a German driving license. Not only did it give me more freedom, but it also allowed me to explore the country using car-sharing apps, which have been great. The process was pretty straightforward, and after doing a lot of research, I can confirm: for Canadians and most residents of Westernized countries,\u00a0**you don\u2019t need an eye exam or extra driving lessons if you already have a full license from your home country.**\u00a0\n\nThe process was simple\u2014I went on the main website of my city to book an appointment to switch my international driver\u2019s license. Try searching for \u201cSwap international driver's license (city)\u201d on Google and it will come up. I also got a driving record from Canada, but I never actually needed to show it and it was a waste of money. Don't do this as it really was a waste of time unless your city specifically asks for it.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: when you exchange your international license for a German one, they keep your Canadian card and only return it when you leave the country permanently. No worries though\u2014after the switch, I contacted my license authority in Quebec to report the card as lost, and they mailed me a new one to my Canadian address, which my parents forwarded to me in Germany. Now, I have both cards. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that you\u2019ll need a passport-sized photo for the new card, and I\u2019d recommend bringing your full binder of documents just in case. In Germany, it's always best to be prepared.\n\n**24. Driving in Germany**\n\nSo, you\u2019ve got your driver\u2019s license\u2014now what about a car? Good news: car sharing in Germany is amazing. I highly recommend downloading the\u00a0**MILES app**\u00a0(which, unfortunately, you cannot use with a Canadian driver\u2019s license, which is why the switch was necessary). It lets you find nearby cars through the app, and you\u2019re charged about \u20ac0.90 per kilometer. For example, a 10 km drive only costs around \u20ac10. If you compare that to owning a car, you\u2019ll save a ton\u2014especially if you\u2019re only driving occasionally. Bonus: most of the cars are electric, so no need to ever stop for gas.\u00a0\n\nAs for driving itself, the rules are pretty similar to Canada. In fact, I\u2019ve found it often feels safer here. Every time I go back to Montreal, I notice how much more intense and fast-paced Canadian drivers are. And yes, there's the Autobahn\u2014Germany\u2019s famous highway with no speed limit. Honestly? It just feels like a regular Canadian highway, except the left lane has a few cars zooming past at lightning speed. You just need to stay alert and keep right unless you're passing. Nothing too wild, definitely doesn\u2019t live up to the hype unless you\u2019re a speed demon.\n\n**25. Renewing your visa for the 2nd year/passport renewal**\n\nAbout three months before your YMV expires, the immigration office will send you a letter reminding you to book a visa renewal appointment. The first thing to do is visit your city\u2019s official immigration website and book an appointment right away to get into the queue. You'll be asked to upload some documents\u2014like your job contract\u2014and that puts you in line for an appointment.\n\nAbout a month later, I got an unexpected email from the immigration office. It said:\u00a0*\u201cEligible participants may participate in this program up to two times, but the two stays must not be immediately consecutive. However, I have contacted the Federal Employment Agency in accordance with Section 19c Paragraph 1 of the Residence Act in conjunction with Section 26 Paragraph 1 of the Employment Ordinance.\u201d*\n\nMy heart sank\u2014I had no idea what it meant. Did I have to leave Germany for six months? A few days? Everything was unclear, and I couldn\u2019t get a straight answer. I replied, explaining the confusion, and thankfully they responded to say there was no issue. Because I had a full-time, ongoing contract, the Federal Employment Agency approved a four-year 19C visa instead, which is basically a standard work visa for non-specialists in Germany. This was amazing news as I could stay until 2028. Huge relief!\u00a0\n\nA few days after that, I got an email with my visa appointment, scheduled for three weeks later. Since I had already submitted my documents online, I just had to show up. At the appointment, they gave me my\u00a0**Aufenthaltstitel**\u2014your official residence permit, which looks a bit like a Canadian driver's license. You\u2019ll use it as ID, for travel, and as proof of residency, so keep it safe. I carry mine in my wallet daily. They\u2019ll ask you to sign a few documents and pay a fee\u2014about \u20ac80. Once that\u2019s done, you're all set. You fucking did it!\n\nOne final tip: While the 19C residence permit is valid for four years, the expiry date on the physical card is tied to your passport expiry date. If your passport expires before those four years are up, you\u2019ll need to get a new passport\u00a0*and*\u00a0pay another \u20ac80 for a new residence card. My suggestion: make sure your passport is valid for at least four years when you apply for this new permit card. I didn\u2019t know this and had to go through the process again after just one year after getting a new passport.\n\n**26. Quick Language tips**\u00a0Learning the language is one of the biggest challenges for expats in Germany. As I mentioned above, when I first moved to Hamburg, I knew zero German\u2014no background, no training\u2014which made things pretty difficult and remains my biggest hurdle. That said, the people I\u2019ve met have been incredibly kind and understanding, which eased a lot of the anxiety early on.\n\nWhile I\u2019m no Duolingo superstar, here are a few methods that have really worked for me:\n\n* **Babbel+ (A1 & A2 courses):**\u00a0Much better than Duolingo, with a clear, structured approach that\u2019s easy to follow. I paid \u20ac50 total!\n* **Assimil German (Falsche Beginner):**\u00a0A fun, workbook-style method from a French company. I use it alongside Babbel.\n* **No language school:**\u00a0I haven\u2019t taken any formal classes, so I can\u2019t speak to that experience.\n\nGerman won\u2019t just come naturally\u2014you have to be consistent. Even 20 minutes a day can go a long way. Also, unlike Scandinavia, most German cities (aside from Berlin or Frankfurt) aren\u2019t very comfortable with English despite what you\u2019ll read and hear. Yes, people can speak English, but it\u2019s definitely not the preference or the default. You\u2019ll struggle to feel truly comfortable without learning the language.\n\n**27. Side jobs and small freelancing gigs**\n\nWondering if you can earn extra money on the side while working full-time in Germany? Good news! I spoke directly with the immigration office, and according to them, as long as you're fulfilling the duties of your full-time job (the one tied to your visa), the government doesn\u2019t care if you earn a little extra on the side\u2014whether that\u2019s through music, freelancing, or small gigs.\n\nThe biggest takeaway:\n\n* **Your full-time job must remain your primary source of income**\n* **You must pay taxes on all income**\n\nIf your freelance income starts exceeding\u00a0**\u20ac15,000/year**, it could raise flags, so it\u2019s best to speak with your local immigration or tax office if you\u2019re heading in that direction.\n\n**28. Moving into your own solo flat**\n\nOne of my biggest moments of victory was finally moving into my own flat. After a year of shared living, I started searching through[\u00a0](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)ImmoScout\u2014*the*\u00a0go-to site for apartments in Germany. You\u2019ll need to pay for the premium version, and honestly, finding a place feels like a full-time job. I was refreshing the page every few minutes and messaging new listings within seconds.\n\nI had all my documents saved and ready to go on my profile. You\u00a0**have to be intense**\u00a0about it. If you\u2019re not checking the app constantly, you\u2019ll be competing against 30\u201350 people who are. As for actually landing a place, it comes down to\u00a0**luck, being organized, giving off a good vibe at the viewing,**\u00a0and having your full application ready.\n\nFor my current apartment, I created a really strong application package. It included:\n\n* My SCHUFA score (which is automatically given to you on the Immoscout website when you pay for the premium version, which is why I paid for it)\n* Proof of salary (last 3 months)\n* A screenshot of my Canadian bank account with some savings\n* A short cover page introducing myself and explaining why I really wanted the flat\n\nPresentation matters. Show that you're serious, reliable, and genuinely excited to move in\u2014it makes a difference. A quick tip when apartment hunting in Germany: rent listings will either say\u00a0**\"\u20acXX warm\"**\u00a0or\u00a0**\"\u20acXX kalt.\"**\n\n* **Warm**\u00a0= all-inclusive (rent + utilities like heating, electricity, etc.)\n* **Kalt**\u00a0= base rent only \u2014 you'll need to\u00a0**add**\u00a0utilities on top of that\n\nMake sure you know which one you're looking at so you can budget properly!\n\n**29. Kaution**\n\nCongrats, you\u2019ve scored a flat\u2014amazing! But just like in Canada, there\u2019s a damage deposit to pay. In Germany, it\u2019s called a\u00a0**Kaution**, and it can be pretty steep\u2014up to three months\u2019 rent in some cases. For example, in my current one-bedroom, the Kaution was \u20ac2,500, which is almost $4,000 CAD. On top of that, I had to pay the first month\u2019s rent, so I was out nearly $5,300 CAD just to move in.\n\nIt was a lot, but after working for a year, I had managed to recover. Some deposits are lower, some higher\u2014it all depends on the place and location. Just a heads up: budget well in advance so this doesn\u2019t catch you off guard.\n\n**30. Kleinanzeigan: the Kijiji of Germany**\n\nFormerly known as eBay Kleinanzeigen, Kleinanzeigan is like the German version of Kijiji, where people buy and sell almost everything. I\u2019ve used it to furnish my entire apartment and highly recommend it to anyone moving to Germany. You can find amazing deals, especially in cities like Hamburg and Munich, where wealthy people often sell high-end furniture, electronics, and household items for a fraction of the price. Create an account and start browsing\u2014you\u2019ll find great items before buying new. Quick tip: check the \u201cfree\u201d section, as people often give away incredible things. I've scored some amazing finds there!\n\n**31. Rundfunkbeitrag: Annoying ass bill**\n\nOne annoying thing about Germany: every household must pay a monthly fee for the\u00a0**Rundfunkbeitrag**, which is essentially a mandatory TV subscription that covers public networks, similar to Canada\u2019s CBC. I have no idea why it\u2019s required, but it costs me\u00a0**\u20ac55 every two months**, and it honestly feels like money down the drain. Unfortunately, you cannot avoid this. If you live with a roommate, luckily it\u2019s divided by your flatmates, so you might only pay like \u20ac10 or something. Still though, blehhhh.\n\n**32. International banking/transfering funds to and from your Canadian account**\n\nIf you're wondering about the best way to handle banking between Germany and Canada, I highly recommend the\u00a0**Wise app**. It lets me easily link my German and Canadian bank accounts, making transfers quick and cheap\u2014usually about \u20ac5 per transfer (although depends on the amount being sent), with funds arriving within 24 to 72 hours. It's been super helpful, especially for paying off Canadian credit card debt with my German income.\n\nI also regularly use my German N26 card, but I occasionally use my Canadian credit cards to build my credit back home. For example, since the Canadian dollar is weaker than the euro, I pay for services like Apple Music and Adobe Creative Cloud in Canadian dollars, which saves me money in the process and allows me to get the same things at a lower rate.\u00a0\n\nConsider your options and choose what works best for you!\n\n**33. Taxes**\n\nIf you're leaving Canada for less than two years, let the CRA and your province know\u2014you'll stay a \"factual resident\" and still get benefits like GST. You'll file a separate tax return in Germany for your income there, but you won\u2019t be double taxed. Just send the CRA your German T4 (earnings slip).\n\nIf you're leaving long-term (2+ years), it\u2019s best to become a \"non-resident\" for tax purposes. You won\u2019t need to file Canadian taxes or report foreign income, but you\u2019ll still be a Canadian citizen. Make sure to inform your health insurance and other agencies about your move.\n\nIt can be confusing and stressful, so do your research early and keep communication clear to avoid issues later.\n\n**34. Arts and culture in Germany: the bold truth**\u00a0\n\nGerman culture is very different from what I expected. Unlike the openness and energy of places like Canada or North America, Germany\u2014especially cities like Hamburg\u2014is more reserved, quiet, and subtle. It\u2019s not that culture is lacking, but it expresses itself in a calmer, more understated way.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for vibrant, loud, artsy energy like in Montreal or LA, Germany might not be the right fit. Many expats struggle because they expect that same openness here.\n\nBut if you\u2019re coming to build resilience, grow personally, and live in a stable, logical country with nature, great infrastructure, and deep-rooted values\u2014you\u2019ll find a lot to love. For me, Germany has been grounding and honest. It\u2019s not flashy, but it\u2019s real. Living here has been the best chapter of my life and taught me so much about strength, confidence, and adaptation.\n\n**35. Closing words**\u00a0\n\nSo, are you ready for a new life? I hope this guide helps you on your journey\u2014it\u2019s the one I wish I had when I first arrived. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed a few things and will update it over time, but this should give you a solid starting point. Now go out there, give it your all, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure.

The university is also very mid and even a bit unorganized I would say and it seems like I would have to go to another city for a good internship.

{"title": "[Advice Needed] Part-time job employer refusing to pay per-hour at the last minute", "selftext": "Hallo! From September to November I worked for a psychology student in Berlin who is disabled and needed someone to help her do her project. The work was completely online, I have never met her. Studierendenwerk Berlin pays her some money each month proportional to the number of hours she has received help from somebody else to do the project. Before I started working, she told me that she would pay me 13\u20ac per hour and that STW pays her 2 months later so I will get the money then. I had told her that 2 months is too late for me and I can only work if she can somehow pay me immediately after the month ends. She agreed. Now by the end of November, I had told her that would be my last month working. She had asked me to do a lot of work which I couldn't complete all of it. \n\nFrom September to mid October I worked 42 hours for which she paid me properly. From mid October to November I worked 40 hours and suddenly she says she does not trust that I worked so much and that STW only allows her to pay 30 hours per month. (The last time she split it into 2 months). She also said at the end that the pay is per task completed and since I had not completed some tasks (but I had made significant progress and the next person can just pick up from there) she would not pay for all my hours. For example, she had me do like 30+ graphs for some data on google sheets, took me 4 hours. 2 days later she had asked me to make some corrections for which I had to make them from scratch which she knew. This took me another 4 hours. 2 days later she says her lecturer asked to make some other changes. I had to make the graphs from scratch again which she knew. This took me another 4 hours. Now she tells me she can only pay me for 4 hours for making the graphs as the other 8 hours were incomplete work. Is she even allowed to do something like that? She says it is not in her control but she needs to prove to STW how much work is completed. But the form which I have to sign only has hours written, not tasks completed. So this does not make sense to me.\n\nSo for the 40 hours I worked, she first said she will pnly pay me for 19 hours. After I explained to her everything, she brought it up to 28 and is now refusing to pay for the remaining 12.  What should I do in this case? I have tried to reason with her. She first said she will pay me the remaining 12 hours in the next month's billing cycle but says she won't anymore. \n\nOther useful info:\n\n1. Since the beginning I had a google sheet where I entered what work I did every hour I worked for which she had the access to.\n2. We dont have a contract on paper but I have proof for everything by mail and Whatsapp.\n3. I can definitely prove that I worked for 40 hours and why exactly the work I did took 40 hours.\n\nThere is a lot more drama that happened since the last week of November which I can tell in comments if somebody is curious. I know the immediate advice is \"get a lawyer\" and that this subreddit cannot give legal advice. But any advice would be appreciated and I will try to get a lawyer once the christmas holidays ends.

What would you choose?\n\nFirst, I have to thank u/thewindinthewillows and u/staplehill for all their help. None of this would have been possible without both of you and I am extremely grateful.Here's a link to my [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/yr6siy/iwantout_26m_student_usa_berlin_germany/).\n\nSo I finally did it. My perfect \\*Plan A\\* has come to fruition.\n\nI have officially been accepted to the International School of Management in Berlin. I have studied German like crazy these past 60ish days and tested at a B1 level on December 16th. My lease is up in March, and my work contract is up in late February. My ISM program would begin on the 13th of March. Everything is lining up perfectly, except...\n\nI am strongly reconsidering this path. I reread u/staplehill 's comment on my original post.\n\n>It would be a lot cheaper to come to Germany for a year on a language learner visa, attend a language course to get your German up to C1, and then study for a German-taught tuition-free degree at a public university [https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/types/other/language-acquisition](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/types/other/language-acquisition)\n\nTheir idea is becoming more and more attractive as I am adding ISM's private university costs. Without small fees which I am sure will add up quickly, my acceptance email states as follows:\n\n>**Bachelor fee structure:**  \n>  \n>Before arrival on campus:  \n>  \n>Deposit: 3,000 \u20ac (refundable with the 1st semester)  \n>  \n>After arrival on campus:  \n>  \n>Enrolment fee: 1,500 \u20ac (non-refundable)  \n>  \n>Tuition fee\\*: 34,200 \u20ac (1st semester: 5,700 \u20ac, 2nd semester: 5,700 \u20ac, 3rd semester: 5,700 \u20ac, 4th semester: 5,700 \u20ac, 5th semester: 5,700 \u20ac, 6th semester: 5,700 \u20ac)  \n>  \n>Semester ticket (free use of public transportation): 1,800 \u20ac (300 \u20ac per semester)  \n>  \n>Total fee: 40,500 \u20ac (-3,000 \u20ac deposit) = **37,500 \u20ac**  \n>  \n>The German Embassy requests to open a **block account** with the amount of **11,208 \u20ac** for the **visa process**. This amount will be paid back in monthly instalments (934 \u20ac per month) during your first year of studies at ISM.

From what I have gathered on Reddit and other forums, a native German would balk at the idea of going to university for 37500 \u20ac. While that number seems reasonable or even low from my American standards, I understand that this might be a rather unjustifiable number that takes advantage of my ignorance and immigrant vulnerability. And let's face it, 0 (well... about 280 x 3 \u20ac) is a whole lot less than 37500 \u20ac. From r/germany's subbar:\n\n>Private universities, with the exception of a handful of well-regarded business schools, have a somewhat dubious reputation in Germany - they are seen as places where people pay for a degree which they would have been unable to get at a public university (presumably because they were not bright or hardworking enough). While degrees from most private universities are fully accredited, employers will likely question why the candidate didn't get their degree from a public university instead.  \n>  \n>Private universities which teach in English and copy many of the trappings of American universities (such as mandatory on-campus housing) are the worst offenders - they are seen as a trap to fleece ignorant foreigners.\n\nSo here I am at the great divide. I have what I have been working for for so long, yet now that I look at it, it might not be as great a bet as I imagined. So this \\*plan B\\* would be,\n\n1. find an intensive language school\n2. get a language learning visa\n3. move to Berlin3.5) hopefully find a job that doesn't mind my B1 level\n4. pass my TestDaF or Goethe Institute German Language Diploma (GDS)\n5. pass my Deutsche Sprachpr\u00fcfung f\u00fcr den Hochschulzugang (DSH) for university\n6. apply for my student visa\n7. go back to america until I get my student visa\n8. hopefully get into a university I like in Berlin\n9. move back to Berlin and begin my studies\n\nThis whole process will take a minimum of a year, probably closer to 18 months. At earliest, I probably would be beginning my actual studies Winter semester 2024 at age 28 and a half. 6 semesters later I'll be 31, and a possible masters later, I'll be 33. As I have heard from many people now, this is not uncommon in Germany, as many people take advantage of free education and go later in life and multiple times. (although, I've been told that in general, Germans have more degrees because of this, rather than my mere bachelors).\n\nSo that's the long and short of it. Only thing holding me back from going with Plan B is that it feels like a gamble. I have a bird in the hand right now, and instead I am going to put it on the line to save money. My language learning abilities are not exactly my strongest suit. These last 8 weeks or so has been the most foreign language I have ever learned, despite both studying Spanish in high school and living in Thailand. I am fearful that I won't be ready for my exams at the end of the program and I will have to devote even more time. With ISM this is a non-concern, as the program is taught in English, with an intensive German course on the side. I also am reluctant to wait even longer to get my career on the road. Despite 31 being an acceptable age to enter your career in Germany, to me it already feels so late. I could be studying at ISM in less than 3 months.\n\nSo what would you do? Expensive bird in the hand versus a cheaper, maybe cooler bird in the bush. I have to accept or deny ISM's offer by the **3rd** **of January 2023.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is my pro and con list:\n\n|International School of Management|1 Year Language Learning Visa|\n|:-|:-|\n|*+* I've already been accepted. The struggle is almost halfway done.|*-* I know little about this path. I have much work and research ahead of me to even get the ball rolling.|\n|*+* The education is taught in English. This might be helpful for the complicated topics I want to study, Economics and Finance.|*-* I have to trust my future German abilities to be strong enough to read and write complicated academic papers.|\n|*+* ISM's German Intensive Language program seems to be quite rigorous. They claim they can get a student from A1 to C1 in 6 semesters.|*+* Learning my education in German might be helpful, as I intend to work in these fields in Germany.|\n||*-* School rankings are not as pertinent in Germany. I have already had trouble determining German schools' worth, but I will have an even harder time in German. See  [https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying/general#wiki\\_rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying/general#wiki_rankings). (1/2)|\n|*+* ISM seems to be consistently ranked around the low 40's in international rankings. To me this seems pretty good, but again, rankings do not hold as much value in Germany as in the US. It is a hard metric for me personally to separate myself from.|*+*  That being said, when exploring international rankings of German universities, the first 20 are always public schools. (2/2)|\n|*+* Based off the schools website and LinkedIn profiles I have stalked, graduates of ISM seem to be successful, but...  (1/4)|*+* After googling around a bunch, there are countless successful politicians, lawyers, CEOS, and most importantly for me, CFOs who all received their first degree from a public German university.|\n|*-* The average student at ISM is extremely well off. During an interview with a... more open professor at ISM, he revealed that most students were quite well off and did not need any form of financial aid to fund their education. These students have had a leg up on the world and probably would have been successful regardless of their university. (2/4)|*+* As someone who has known poverty their entire lives until the last few years of their life, I do not relate as well to upper-crusters versus working class people. I might not gel with the young private school students. That being said... (1/2)|\n|*+*That being said, having powerful connections is a valuable asset. A large portion of my previous career was built upon whom I knew and what positions they'd held. Rich and connected friends can be quite helpful, especially in business. (3/4)|*-* Having well off friends and thus future business partners might be an advantage in the business world. It has been helpful in my life up until now. Public universities might not offer me those same opportunities. (2/2)|\n|*-* ISM runs very capitalistically. Their advertising and aggressive sales tactics remind me of exactly what I detest back home in America. I believe the \"Decide by Jan 3rd,\" ultimatum ISM has put on me is a high pressure sales tactic, as after some digging, I have found that I think I actually have until the end of January.  For-Profit education is something I am intrinsically against and misaligns with my personal values. (4/4)|*+* Socialized university aligns with my personal and political values. I would be honored to be a part of such a system. It is ultimately one of the reasons I want to move and raise a family in the country.|\n|*+* ISM has a heavy emphasis on internationality in their curriculum. As someone who will have lived in 3 different countries, my internationality might be a good trait to bolster.   One semester must be spent abroad, but... (1/2)|*-* My education might be purely Germany oriented. I would like the freedom of using my education world wide, should I want to go home. Will my future education at a public university allow me that freedom?|\n|*-* That abroad semester will cost me more money one way or another. I will be fluent in German and English. This limits my semester abroad university choices to German-speaking countries, English-speaking countries or English taught universities elsewhere like Bangkok University. While my ISM tuition would go towards tuition at those institutions, there is a high chance that the German or English universities would be more expensive and I would have to make up the difference. Even though Bangkok University would be cheaper, I still would have to make up the moving and living expenses. (2/2)|*+* The only costs I would have to concern myself with are education costs and costs of living. Various miscellaneous education costs have been estimated to be between 260 and 300 \u20ac a year and costs of living between 930 and 1200 \u20ac a year. I will also have to pay for extra flights to and from America while I wait for my student visa. This seems doable between my savings and a part time job. (1/2)|\n|*-* I will not have time to hold a job in addition to my studies. ISM states that they discourage a student accepting more employment than 10 hours a week.|*+* Many Germans work during their education. This would be essential to covering living costs as well as raising my quality of life. Plus, I value working. Labor is meaningful to me. (2/2)|\n|*-* ISM's student body is quite young. When I asked that same honest professor about the average student's age, he said that most first years are between the ages of 18 and 20. I would be the old man in this situation. I enjoy young people just fine and have no shame in being the odd-man-out, but again, social connections in your chosen field are a vital part of going to university. I might have an uphill social battle to secure and maintain relations with my peers.|*+* There will be many Germans and others in similar situations to myself in both life path and age. I should find it easy to meet and bond with my peers at a public school.|\n|*-* There seems to be a general distrust and scorn against private universities by the average German. Between Reddit, Youtube (see EasyGerman) and other forums, I have noted a significant disdain for non-public universities in Germany, ranging from \\[paraphrasing\\] \"it is the same or worse education for incredible amounts of money,\" to \"Most private universities are complete frauds and are little more than a trap to fleece ignorant foreigners.\" Reddit's r/Germany even states \"\\[Private universities in Germany\\] are seen as places where people pay for a degree which they would have been unable to get at a public university (presumably because they were not bright or hardworking enough). While degrees from most private universities are fully accredited, employers will likely question why the candidate didn't get their degree from a public university instead.\"  [https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying/general#wiki\\_public\\_and\\_private\\_universities](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying/general#wiki_public_and_private_universities)|*+* Going to university for free through my own will and determination in another country in another language would be a very valuable accomplishment for me. I would feel prideful for my hard work and should I ever follow my dream of becoming a German citizen, I would consider it a valuable and important experience in my mental naturalization process. I would be experiencing something most Germans also experience.|\n|*+* ISM's program begins in March 2023, less than 3 months. This aligns well with both my lease and work contract ending. The transition will be smooth. I will get to start pursuing my dream in a very short amount of time. I will have my degree by early 2026 at age 30.|*-x2* I do not know how long it will take to begin this plan. It will most likely take longer than 3 months in visas alone. As a soon-to-be 27 year old, I do not have much time to spend. I need every minute I can get and the ambiguity of this plan costs time, not to mention the extra year that I will spend Language Learning. This will most likely add a year and a half to my plans landing me a degree at age 31.5 in Winter 2027.|\n|*+* This ISM program is essentially a sure thing. At this point, there is little left to chance, other than securing my visa, loans, and housing, the bulk of the uncertainty is over.|*-x2* At this time, there are many factors left to chance with this plan. I do not have a language program selected. I do not know if I will be able to get a job in Germany with my B1 language proficiency. I do not know if I will successfully pass my language tests. I do not know if I will find and be accepted into a University program that suits me. I do not know if I will be in a place financially to deposit enough into the Blocked Bank Account come mid-2024. All this on top of securing my visa twice and housing twice. My whole purpose of pursuing this degree is for a sure thing. I have already done the \"let's cross our fingers and hope this goes somewhere\" degree. I've devoted 10 years of my life to it. I am not trying to take anymore chances. This whole idea is supposed to be the safe option. This plan does not align with that sentiment.|\n|*-x3* The obvious one. The cost. **37,500 \u20ac is a freakin lot**. I will have to apply for loans and go into debt. No two ways about it. I have always paid off every debt I've had in less than a year. This will be something I am not proud of and will hang over me many many years into my career.|*+* 300 \u20ac miscellaneous costs times 3 years. round trip flights from Berlin to Phoenix cost around 500 \u20ac booked a month in advance. 1.400 \u20ac is a pretty damn cheap education. And I'd be doing it the German way.|\n\ndas macht zusammen:  \nISM 0  \nPublic +1  \nhmmmmmmmm...", "author": "ICanBeBetterIfITry", "created_utc": 1671637803.0, "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/zrrkjp/private_school_or_1_year_language_visa/", "num_comments": 21, "subreddit": "germany", "id": "zrrkjp", "search_context": "\"job hunting\" OR \"finding a job\" OR \"student job\" OR \"part time job\" AND student AND Berlin"}

Are the studies intensive? Will I have time for a part time job besides studying? Is the transportation system good in Schweinfurt? Is the cost of living high there? Do most people speak only German or do they know English as well?\n\n\nUPDATE: I have been living in Schweinfurt for 3 years now, here is my experience:\n\nI find the programme (IMC Mechatronics) to be very good. There are many decent professors. After 3 years of studying, i did not regret enrolling to this programme at all. I do have to say that there is a lot to study. If you want to become a good engineer, be ready to study well. Many of my colleagues unfortunately did not manage to finish this programme and switched to a less difficult one. The living expenses in Schweinfurt for a student amount to roughly 700\u20ac-800\u20ac a month (rent, food, everything). Culture is pretty german. Not many locals know english. Do not expect it to be like in Berlin or M\u00fcnchen. Please learn german at least to level A2 before coming to study here, even if your degree (IMC Mechatronics) is in english.

You can use \u201ewg-gesucht.de\u201c if you are looking to share an apartment with somebody. If you start looking 2 months before coming to Schweinfurt, you will be left (most likely) with the expensive rent options. It is definitely possible to work part time, but from experience there are mostly jobs like \u201estorage worker\u201c or \u201ecashier\u201c and other physical jobs.

If you're Canadian and between 18 and 35 you can get a 1 year working holiday visa (as long as you show proof of sufficient funds for a few months). This means you can move to Germany for a while before applying.\n\n**Step 1: Find a German University that offers a program you're interested in.**  \nGermany, unlike the United States, requires you to choose your degree program before enrolling. You do not just take a little of this and a little of that until you decide what to do. **Most undergraduate degree programs in Germany are taught in German, not in English.** [Here](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programs/en/?p=l&q=&degree[]=1&subject=0&lang[]=2&langDistribution=0) is a list of German university programs in English. [Here](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/studiengang/en/?a=result&q=&degree=24&courselanguage=&studylocation=&locations=&admissionsemester=&sort=name&page=1) is a list of all German university programs.\n\n**Step 2: Organize your needed materials to apply. Ex: High school diploma, SAT scores, ACT scores.**  \nIf you did not graduate with at least a 3.5 GPA, and get high scores on your SAT or ACT with writing, turn back now. German universities only let in a fraction of international students for each German student, because they want to educate their citizens first. For the degree program I selected at HTW in Berlin they allowed a total of 50 students in each year and only 7 were allowed to be international.\n\n**Step 3: Submit a uni-assist.**  \nInternational students wishing to study in Germany must submit their applications via Uni-Assist. It costs 75euro for the first university application, and 15euro for each additional one for the same semester. If you wish to apply to another program for a later semester you must pay 75euro again. (75EUR is roughly $95.) From my experience uni-assist takes a loooooooooong time. My process was streamlined because I lived in Germany and was able to drop off my applications in person at the office.\n\n**Step 4: Wait.**  \nNow you wait to find out if you were accepted. Unlike the United States, you will NOT find out months before the semester begins. Most likely you'll find out 1 month or so before. This will make moving to Germany a bit rushed.\n\n**Step 5: The response.**  \nYou will receive a response from your university as to whether or not you were accepted. If you weren't, sorry. It's a tough process. You can try again, but honestly I would just forget it and try another country if you MUST study in Europe (The Netherlands offers MANY courses in English, but is not free). If you were accepted, congratulations! Now your headaches really begin!\n\n**Step 6: The visa.**  \nTo receive a student visa in Germany you must be enrolled in a university. Once you've received your acceptance letter you can accept the spot and have to pay fees. *What do you mean fees? Germany just got rid of their fees!* Yes, they got rid of their tuition fees, but not the other ones. You still have to pay a few hundred Euro per semester for student organizations and your train ticket. It is worth it though, the ticket comes at a highly discounted price.  \nOnce your fees are paid you will get proof from your university that you are enrolled. Now comes the fun. If you're in your home country you contact the German embassy/consulate to start the visa process. If you're in Germany.. lucky you! You get to go to the Auslaenderbehoerde! What is the Auslaenderbehoerde? Well, it's the first German word I learned to spell in my sleep. They are the foreign office tasked with helping us non-EU citizens get visas. And boy are they a friendly bunch!  \nTo get a student visa in Germany you will need proof that you can sustain yourself. You need roughly 8000EUR (roughly $10,000) in your German bank account at the beginning of the school year, each year. What does this mean? Either your parents need to sign a statement that they will 100% support you and give proof with bank statements showing they have enough income to give you the money. You can also get scholarships (more on this in a second), get a loan (from Germany, which is hard to do), or have a permanent German resident (citizen or not) sign a declaration that they will financially support you. Keep in mind, German degree programs last between 3 and 4 years, so you will need in total $30,000 or $40,000 to just get your visa for each of the years.  \nYou NEED health insurance. Your university can help you get this sorted.  \nOnce you have all of this covered: Congratulations! Time to move to Germany!\n\n**FAQs**\n\n1. **What about scholarships?**  \nGermany offers very few scholarships, especially for undergraduate studies. You can find some at the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/en/), but prepare to be disappointed.\n2. **So I got accepted and my visa is sorted out, what about living situations?**  \nGerman universities typically do not offer student housing. Some do, but the amount of places is very limited and it fills up very fast. Most likely you'll need to find a WG (apartment share) in the city where you're studying. You can search for a WG [here](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/). In most cities these fill up very fast and you will need to go for an interview. You'll have a difficult time finding a place to live when you're not in the country.\n3. **$10,000 per year? Will this be enough for me to go out and party?**  \nSimply put: No. This will cover your living expenses, health insurance, and food costs.\n4. **What? So then how am I supposed to do things?**  \nLuckily, on a student visa you can get a job. Only a part time job, but still. You can work either 90 full-time days a year or 180 part-time days. Finding a job will be difficult if you don't speak German and do not live in a major international city. Berlin would be the easiest to find work without needing to speak German. But be warned, English is a dime a dozen. You are not unique because you speak English.\n5. **Do I need to speak German?**  \nShort answer: Yes. Long answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss. While many of your friends you make at school will speak English, you'll need at least basic German to get by in every day life. Important documents must be done in German, bank accounts are opened in German, rental agreements are usually in German, and obviously people around you will speak German. Speaking *some* German is not enough. It might be if you want to move to Germany and never do anything other than hang out with other English speakers, but if you want to really appreciate the country and culture, learn some damn German.\n\nIt has been a few years since my application procedure, so please feel free to correct me if I have misremembered anything. If there's anything I've missed, please add it as well.\n\n**List of important resources**  \n[DAAD - Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst - German Academic Exchange Service](https://www.daad.de/de/)  \n[Uni-Assist](http://www.uni-assist.de/index_en.html)  \n[Study-In-DE](https://www.study-in.de/en/)  \n[Study in Holland \\(just because!\\)](http://www.studyinholland.nl/)\n\nI will end this by saying Germany is a fantastic country. I lived there for years, made friends for life, and have wonderful memories. I miss it every day with every fiber of my being and hope some day I'll be back. Studying in Germany is much more difficult and more rigid than the US. You'll be in class 5 days a week and for most of the day. Don't eat out often, and buy beer from the grocery store and you'll be fine.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the feedback. There is tons of great info in the comments, so I urge everyone to read them! I would like to clarify that not every experience will be 100% like mine. Hopefully you won't take a hour and a half u-bahn and bus ride to Uni-Assist only to realize you forgot your paperwork at home!\n\nIf you have any specific questions please feel free to shoot me a PM and ask away! If I can't answer your question I'll try to point you in the direction of someone who can.\n\nI am in no way an expert at this process nor am I associated with any universities.\n\nEdit 2: I am still receiving many PMs from this post. It seems the main point I'm trying to make is lost on many of you so here it is in back and white: **This will NOT save you money. You need about $15,000 PER YEAR just to survive.** You cannot get a loan. You need to have the money in the bank or have your parents pay to keep you going. If you happen to have about $60,000 in the bank then just go to undergrad in the US, take German classes, and do your master's in Germany.", "author": "DeineBlaueAugen", "created_utc": 1412244606.0, "score": 525, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/2i2trw/so_you_want_to_study_undergraduate_in_germany/", "num_comments": 160, "subreddit": "germany", "id": "2i2trw", "search_context": "\"job hunting\" OR \"finding a job\" OR \"student job\" OR \"part time job\" AND student AND Berlin"}

{"title": "Applying for MSc Physics as a BEng Mech. Eng. Graduate", "selftext": "Hi r/germany, I'm looking for a little advice.\n\nI graduated this summer with a BEng in  Mechanical Engineering from a top 20 UK university and am looking to study for a masters in physics in Germany. I have identified a number of universities that teach in English (as my German is not yet up to scratch) and have been looking at prerequisites for their courses. I am aware many universities use competency tests but I need to get past the first level of application to face them.\n\nIn general, they require a BSc in physics, but also accept mathematics and natural sciences degrees. I would argue that my degree is just as relevant to physics as a biology or maths degree. (Also, my bachelors is actually aeronautical, not mechanical engineering, but they have a lot of cross-over and the latter is far more well known. I would say aero has more fluid dynamics than mech though I'm not so sure on what we missed out on).\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. Is my bachelor degree relevant enough? If not, is it typically possible to take a selection of undergraduate courses to 'convert'?\n2. Is the admission competition for prestigious universities high at postgraduate level? Specifically, is it realistic to apply to LMU, TUM, HU-Berlin, KIT, etc. with a 2:2 non-physics degree?\n3. Are part time jobs available for students with only basic German? Is there any other way a foreigner can ease the financial burden?

{"title": "35/M/EU Citizen/US -> Europe for grad school and career", "selftext": "Hello Redditors! Long time reader, first time poster who appreciates any suggestions.\u0003\n\nI and a 35 year old American man who lives in Oakland, California. English is my first language. I have been working as a server in a fine dining restaurant for many years and make a reasonably comfortable salary for the area. I have an undergraduate degree in English with a minor in Italian studies. I applied for and received an Italian passport. I have saved up enough money over the years and am considering using it to move abroad, or use it for a down payment on a condo which I can then rent out when I move away. In this respect my budget is dependent on whether or not my money is tied up in property, and is somewhat flexible.\n\nI have applied for numerous English-language master's programs in Europe in the field I would like to work in (I will outline this in a bit) but have found it difficult to be accepted without a background in it. My interests are broad and I would like to find a country and a school with a master's degree that will prepare me for a career change after having finished school 13 years ago.\n\nLiving near and working in San Francisco has accustomed me to a certain level of diversity and quality of life. I am looking for somewhere to study for a couple years (2 year programs only) that will be provide something similarly interesting but in a different context (i.e. no provincial backwaters, please, unless there is something to be gained from the experience).\n\nMy ultimate goal is to work with the Foreign Service after gaining some practical experience in international work. This means taking my background in the humanities and transitioning it to one in the social sciences. I would like a broad interdisciplinary field containing elements of political science, philosophy, sociology, psychoanalysis, history, anthropology and cultural theory (imagine a Slavoj Zizek University and I'm there). I have lived in Italy for school and speak Italian and Spanish, but I am not interested in living in these countries.\n\nI am particularly interested in continental/Northern Europe in preparation for an international career. Only public universities with free or very low tuition. I am looking at Berlin, Paris, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Uppsala, Vienna, Leipzig, Brussels, Amsterdam, Leuven. Ideally I would also learn a new language while studying in English, preferably French or German, although I've found only one masters that meets my criteria that is taught in English in France (Paris Diderot's American/English studies). In Berlin, both Freie and Humboldt seem to have programs that are professional and theoretical in nature. They are tuition-free and provide a transit pass for the city.\n\nBased on what I have written, what are some of the ideal places to study in Europe? Where else should I consider? Is there anywhere that can offer a culturally interesting/unique study environment at a relatively low cost of living for a student? I like the subsidized nature and social structure of Northern Europe, and have heard that the Danish government pays a stipend to students who work a part-time job while going to school. The quality of life this would allow is appealing to me. Are there any other places or schools with similar opportunities I should be aware of? I am also open to the idea of staying in the country where I've studied if I am able to support myself comfortably.\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions, consideration or advice!", "author": "rockrotandrule", "created_utc": 1563659065.0, "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/cfrb2o/35meu_citizenus_europe_for_grad_school_and_career/", "num_comments": 12, "subreddit": "IWantOut", "id": "cfrb2o", "search_context": "\"job hunting\" OR \"finding a job\" OR \"student job\" OR \"part time job\" AND student AND Berlin"}

You either have the money on a bank account or you have a scholarship or you have parents with a high income who promise to pay for you, etc.\n\nIf your educational background is equivalent to the educational background of German high school students, you can enter German university directly.
